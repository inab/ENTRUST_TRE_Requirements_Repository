  "Requirement ID": "R006",
  "Title": "Access to open resources from TRE",
  "Description": "Most of the genomic analyses require some kind of data on the outside world, be it a reference genome or annotation databases. In some cases these can be downloaded pre-analysis to the TRE, but this tends to hinder analysis workflows that, from the POV of the users, work on the outside of a TRE. Examples: annotation of genomes, reference sequences for sequence alignment, usage of ontologies and other open resources.",
